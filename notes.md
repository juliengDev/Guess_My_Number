1. Generate a random number between 0 and 20.
2. Retrieve the number entered by the player in the check input field.

There are four possible scenarios:

a. The player does not enter any number and clicks on the check button.
=> Display a message notifying the player to enter a number.

b. The player enters a higher number and clicks on the check button.
=> Inform the player that they have entered a higher value. Encourage the player to try again.

    (Encapsulate the code below into a function)
    => Subtract 1 from the score.
    => Update the score on the webpage.
    => If the player reaches a score of 0, they lose the game; display a message accordingly.
    => Allow them to play again by clicking the "Again!" button to reset the game.

c. The player enters a lower number and clicks on the check button.

    (Encapsulate the code below into a function)
    => Subtract 1 from the score.
    => Update the score on the webpage.
    => If the player reaches a score of 0, they lose the game; display a message accordingly.
    => Allow them to play again by clicking the "Again!" button to reset the game.

d. The player enters the same number and wins the game.
